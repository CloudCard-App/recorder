# Flashcard-App-Recorder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Flashcard-App/Flashcard-App-Recorder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Flashcard-App/Flashcard-App-Recorder)

Records the student activity using my Android flashcard app. See my FlashCard-App repo.

This is the back-end, unexposed web back-end of my Flashcard-App projects. It receives REST POST requests from the Android users, and writes them into the database. It uses Node.js with Express.js, writing into a MongoDB database. The UI is very primitive and not meant for any real use.
